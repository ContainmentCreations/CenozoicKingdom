# 🦴 Cenozoic Kingdom

A Minecraft 1.18.2 Fabric mod that brings ancient creatures back to life! BTW my first mod ever, so I am excited and pleased to say that this mod is Open-Source

**Disclaimer**: Some assets are placeholders, some assets are missing but will be definetely changed in future, this very early pre-alpha 0.0.1 version is only to demonstrate ideas for mod

## 📦 What is Cenozoic Kingdom?

Cenozoic Kingdom is a mod focused on **prehistoric life, ancient DNA, and fossil technology**. Collect, analyze, and synthesize DNA from the past to reconstruct the creatures of the Cenozoic era—and beyond.

## 🔬 Features

- **Analyzer Block**  
  Process items like `frozen_bone`, `frozen_meat`, and `frozen_skin` to extract ancient DNA. (names/tags will maybe change in the future)

- **Synthetizer Block**  
  Combine basic DNA (e.g. `cenozoic_dna`, `paleozoic_dna`, `modern_dna` (all are very, very, very early names, and are definetely subject to change) to create **specific DNA** (like `mastodon_dna`, `dimetrodon_dna` (more to come in future...).

- **Mutation System**  
  Some materials may yield rare `mutated_dna` or `hybrid_dna`—these are unstable and unpredictable... (very, very, very future feature...)

- **Destroyed DNA Failures**  
  Not every synthesis goes as planned—failures will give you `destroyed_dna`. (partially implemented, subject to change)
